SBMLToolbox logo
================

The SBMLToolbox logo here was created by Mike Hucka.  The MATLAB-like logo incorporated into the SBMLToolbox logo came from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Matlab_Logo.png); it was created by user [Jarekt](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jarekt) and is described thus: "First eigenfunction of the L-shaped membrane, resembling (but not identical) to MATLAB's logo".  The [file on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Matlab_Logo.png) is in the public domain.
