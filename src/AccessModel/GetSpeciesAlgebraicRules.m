function [Species, AlgebraicRules] = GetSpeciesAlgebraicRules(SBMLModel)
% GetSpeciesAlgebraicRules takes an SBMLModel 
% and returns
%             1) an array of species names
%             2) an array of the character representation of each algebraic
%                   rule the species appears in
