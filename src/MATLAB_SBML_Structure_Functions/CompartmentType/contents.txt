###MATLAB_SBML_STRUCTURE_FUNCTIONS\COMPARTMENTTYPE


The functions allow users to create and work with the SBML CompartmentType structure.

Function are:

----------

####CompartmentType = CompartmentType_create(level(optional), version(optional) )

Takes

1. level, an integer representing an SBML level (optional)
2. version, an integer representing an SBML version (optional)

Returns

1. a MATLAB_SBML CompartmentType structure of the appropriate level and version

*NOTE:* the optional level and version preserve backwards compatibility
  a missing version argument will default to L1V2; L2V4 or L3V1
  missing both arguments will default to L3V1
