% isSBML_Compartment(SBMLStructure, Level) checks that SBMLStructure represents a compartment 
% within an sbml model of the specified level
% 
% if SBMLStructure represents a compartment within an SBML model
% it has the following fields 
% eg    Typecode
%       Notes
%       Annotations
%       Name
%       Id (2)
%       SpatialDimensions (2)
%       Size (2)
%       Volume (1)
%       Units
%       Outside
%       Constant (2)
%       isSetSize (2)
%       isSetVolume
%
% NOTE number in brackets indicates field is appropriate for that level of
% sbml only
%
% Returns 1 if SBMLStructure is a structure containing each of the above
% fields and the typecode is "SBML_COMPARTMENT"
% 
% Returns 0 if SBMLStructure is not a structure 
% or does not contain one of the above fields
% or the typecode is not "SBML_COMPARTMENT"
