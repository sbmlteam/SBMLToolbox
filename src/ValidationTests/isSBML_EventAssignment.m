function y = isSBML_EventAssignment(varargin)
% isSBML_EventAssignment(SBMLStructure, Level, Version(optional)) 
% checks that SBMLStructure represents a EventAssignment
% within an sbml model of specified level
% 
% if SBMLStructure represents a EventAssignment within an SBML model
% it has the appropriate fields (ONLY IN LEVEL 2)
% eg    Typecode (2)
%       Notes (2)
%       Annotations (2)
%       Variable (2)
%       MathFormula (2)
%
% NOTE number in brackets indicates field is appropriate for that level of
% sbml only
%
% Returns 1 if SBMLStructure is a structure containing each of the above
% fields and the typecode is "SBML_EVENT_ASSIGNMENT"
% 
% Returns 0 if SBMLStructure is not a structure 
% or does not contain one of the above fields
% or the typecode is not "SBML_EVENT_ASSIGNMENT"
