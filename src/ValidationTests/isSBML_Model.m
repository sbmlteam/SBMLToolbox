function y = isSBML_Model(SBMLStructure)
% isSBML_Model(SBMLStructure) checks that SBMLStructure represents an sbml model
% 
% if SBMLStructure represents an SBML model
% it has the appropriate fields 
% eg    Typecode
%       Notes
%       Annotations
%       Level
%       Version
%       Name
%       Id (2)
%       ListFunctionDefinition (2)
%       ListUnitDefinition
%       ListCompartment
%       ListSpecies
%       ListParameter
%       ListRule
%       ListReaction
%       ListEvent (2)
%
% NOTE number in brackets indicates field is appropriate for that level of
% sbml only
%
% Returns 1 if SBMLStructure is a structure containing each of the above
% fields and the typecode is "SBML_MODEL"
% 
% Returns 0 if SBMLStructure is not a structure 
% or does not contain one of the above fields
% or the typecode is not "SBML_MODEL"
