% isSBML_Unit(SBMLStructure, Level) checks that SBMLStructure represents a unit 
% within an sbml model of specified level
% 
% if SBMLStructure represents a unit within an SBML model
% it has the appropriate fields 
% eg    Typecode
%       Notes
%       Annotations
%       Kind
%       Exponent
%       Scale
%       Multiplier (2)
%       Offset (2)
%
% NOTE number in brackets indicates field is appropriate for that level of
% sbml only
%
% Returns 1 if SBMLStructure is a structure containing each of the above
% fields and the typecode is "SBML_UNIT"
% 
% Returns 0 if SBMLStructure is not a structure 
% or does not contain one of the above fields
% or the typecode is not "SBML_UNIT"
