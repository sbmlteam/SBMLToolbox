function varargout = ViewEventAssignment(varargin)
% ViewEventAssignment takes
%                        a MATLAB_SBML EventAssignment structure
%                 and drives a GUI that illustrates the eventAssignment structure fields and values 
%
%       NOTE: at present there is no output from this function but it could
%       be edited to allow creation and editing of the eventAssignment
