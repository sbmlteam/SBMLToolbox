###FBC_PACKAGE\VALIDATE_MATLAB_SBML_STRUCTURES


This folder contains tests that checks that the structure supplied as argument 
is of the appropriate form to represent the intended element of an SBML model
that includes the fbc package.

Function are:

----------

####[valid, message] = isSBML_FBC_FluxBound(SBMLFBCFluxBound, level, version, pkgVersion)

Takes

1. SBMLStructure, an SBML FBC FluxBound structure
2. level, an integer representing an SBML level
3. version, an integer representing an SBML version
4. pkgVersion, an integer representing an FBC package version

Returns

1. valid = 
  - 1, if the structure represents
       a MATLAB_SBML FBC FluxBound structure of the appropriate
       level, version and FBC version
  - 0, otherwise
2. a message explaining any failure

*NOTE:* The fields present in a MATLAB_SBML FBC FluxBound structure of the appropriate
level and version can be found using getFluxBoundFieldnames(level, version, pkgVersion)



------------------------------

####[valid, message] = isSBML_FBC_FluxObjective(SBMLFBCFluxObjective, level, version, pkgVersion)

Takes

1. SBMLStructure, an SBML FBC FluxObjective structure
2. level, an integer representing an SBML level
3. version, an integer representing an SBML version
4. pkgVersion, an integer representing an FBC package version

Returns

1. valid = 
  - 1, if the structure represents
       a MATLAB_SBML FBC FluxObjective structure of the appropriate
       level, version and FBC version
  - 0, otherwise
2. a message explaining any failure

*NOTE:* The fields present in a MATLAB_SBML FBC FluxObjective structure of the appropriate
level and version can be found using getFluxObjectiveFieldnames(level, version, pkgVersion)



------------------------------

####[valid, message] = isSBML_FBC_Model(SBMLFBCModel, level, version, pkgVersion)

Takes

1. SBMLStructure, an SBML FBC Model structure
2. level, an integer representing an SBML level
3. version, an integer representing an SBML version
4. pkgVersion, an integer representing an FBC package version

Returns

1. valid = 
  - 1, if the structure represents
       a MATLAB_SBML FBC Model structure of the appropriate
       level, version and FBC version
  - 0, otherwise
2. a message explaining any failure

*NOTE:* The fields present in a MATLAB_SBML FBC Model structure of the appropriate
level and version can be found using getModelFieldnames(level, version, pkgVersion)



------------------------------

####[valid, message] = isSBML_FBC_Objective(SBMLFBCObjective, level, version, pkgVersion)

Takes

1. SBMLStructure, an SBML FBC Objective structure
2. level, an integer representing an SBML level
3. version, an integer representing an SBML version
4. pkgVersion, an integer representing an FBC package version

Returns

1. valid = 
  - 1, if the structure represents
       a MATLAB_SBML FBC Objective structure of the appropriate
       level, version and FBC version
  - 0, otherwise
2. a message explaining any failure

*NOTE:* The fields present in a MATLAB_SBML FBC Objective structure of the appropriate
level and version can be found using getObjectiveFieldnames(level, version, pkgVersion)



------------------------------

####[valid, message] = isSBML_FBC_Species(SBMLFBCSpecies, level, version, pkgVersion)

Takes

1. SBMLStructure, an SBML FBC Species structure
2. level, an integer representing an SBML level
3. version, an integer representing an SBML version
4. pkgVersion, an integer representing an FBC package version

Returns

1. valid = 
  - 1, if the structure represents
       a MATLAB_SBML FBC Species structure of the appropriate
       level, version and FBC version
  - 0, otherwise
2. a message explaining any failure

*NOTE:* The fields present in a MATLAB_SBML FBC Species structure of the appropriate
level and version can be found using getSpeciesFieldnames(level, version, pkgVersion)



------------------------------

####[valid, message] = isValidFBC(SBMLStruct, level, version, pkgVersion)

Takes

1. SBMLStruct, an SBML  structure
2. level, an integer representing an SBML level
3. version, an integer representing an SBML version
4. pkgVersion, an integer representing the FBC package version

Returns

1. valid = 
  - 1, if the structure represents
       a MATLAB_SBML FBC structure of the appropriate
       level and version
  - 0, otherwise
2. a message explaining any failure

*NOTE:* The fields present in a MATLAB_SBML  structure of the appropriate
level and version can be found using getFieldnames(typecode, level, version)
