function fail = TestIsSpeciesInReaction
% IsSpeciesInReaction(SBMLSpecies, SBMLReaction)takes an SBML species and  reaction
% and determines where the species takes part in the reaction
%
% returns   0   if species is NOT part of the reaction
% or        n   if the species is part of the reaction
%               where n is the number of times it occurs
