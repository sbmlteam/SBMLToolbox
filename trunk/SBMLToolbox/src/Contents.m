%
% SBMLToolbox is an open-source MATLAB toolbox that provides a MATLAB user 
% with functions for reading, writing and manipulation data expressed 
% in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
% 
% It works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS systems. 
% 
% The SBMLToolbox supports reading and writing of all levels
% and versions of SBML up to L3V1 Core.
%
%
% FUNCTIONS include:
%
%
% toolbox\AccessModel
%
%       This directory contains functions that allow the user to
%       derive information from a SBML Model
%
%
% toolbox\Convenience
%
%       This directory contains a number of convenience functions for
%       checking information or manipulating math expressions.
%
% toolbox\MATLAB_SBML_Structure_Functions
%
%       This directory contains functions that allow the user to
%       manipulate a MATLAB_SBML Model structure
%
%       The majority of functions mimic their equivalent within the 
%       libSBML C API.
%
% toolbox\Simulation
%
%       This directory contains functions to simulate an SBML model
%
% toolbox\Validate_MATLAB_SBML_Structures
% 
%       This directory contains functions to validate the MATLAB_SBML
%       structures
