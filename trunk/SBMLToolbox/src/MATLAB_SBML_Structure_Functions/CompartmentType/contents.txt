###MATLAB SBML STRUCTURE FUNCTIONS\COMPARTMENTTYPE


The functions allow users to create and work with the SBML CompartmentType structure.

Function are:

----------

####CompartmentType = CompartmentType_create(level(optional), version(optional)

takes

1. level; an integer representing an SBML level (optional)
2. version; an integer representing an SBML version (optional)

returns

1. a MATLAB_SBML CompartmentType structure of the appropriate level and version

*NOTE:* the optional level and version preserve backwards compatibility: 
   
   - a missing version argument will default to L1V2; L2V4 or L3V1
   - missing both arguments will default to L3V1


------------------------------

####id = CompartmentType_getId(SBMLCompartmentType)

1. SBMLCompartmentType; an SBML CompartmentType structure

returns

1. the value of the metaid attribute



------------------------------

####name = CompartmentType_getName(SBMLCompartmentType)

takes

1. SBMLCompartmentType; an SBML CompartmentType structure

returns

1. the value of the name attribute



------------------------------

####sboTerm = CompartmentType_getSBOTerm(SBMLCompartmentType)

takes

1. SBMLCompartmentType; an SBML CompartmentType structure

returns

1. the value of the sboTerm attribute



------------------------------

####value = CompartmentType_isSetId(SBMLCompartmentType)

takes

1. SBMLCompartmentType; an SBML CompartmentType structure

returns

1. value = 
 - 1 if the id attribute is set
 - 0 otherwise



------------------------------

####value = CompartmentType_isSetMetaid(SBMLCompartmentType)

takes

1. SBMLCompartmentType; an SBML CompartmentType structure

------------------------------

####value = CompartmentType_isSetSBOTerm(SBMLCompartmentType)

takes

1. SBMLCompartmentType; an SBML CompartmentType structure

returns

1. value = 
 - 1 if the sboTerm attribute is set
 - 0 otherwise



------------------------------

####SBMLCompartmentType = CompartmentType_setId(SBMLCompartmentType, id)

takes

1. SBMLCompartmentType; an SBML CompartmentType structure
2. id; a string representing the id to be set

returns

1. the SBML CompartmentType structure with the new value for the id attribute



------------------------------

####SBMLCompartmentType = CompartmentType_setMetaid(SBMLCompartmentType, metaid)

------------------------------

####SBMLCompartmentType = CompartmentType_setSBOTerm(SBMLCompartmentType, sboTerm)

takes

1. SBMLCompartmentType; an SBML CompartmentType structure
2. sboTerm; an integer representing the sboTerm to be set
