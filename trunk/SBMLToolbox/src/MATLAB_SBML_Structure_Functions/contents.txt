###MATLAB SBML STRUCTURE FUNCTIONS


These are general functions for working with MATLAB_SBML structures.

Function are:

----------

####level = GetLevel(SBMLStructure) 

takes 

1. SBMLStructure; any SBML structure

returns 

1. the SBML level corresponding to this structure

*NOTE:* it is not always possible to uniquely determine the level from a
structure. The most recent SBML level that matches will be reported.


------------------------------

####[level, version] = GetLevelVersion(SBMLStructure) 

takes 

1. SBMLStructure; any SBML structure

returns 

1. the SBML level corresponding to this structure
2. the SBML version corresponding to this structure

*NOTE:* it is not always possible to uniquely determine the level/version from a
structure. The most recent SBML level/version that matches will be reported.


------------------------------

####SBMLStructure = Object_create(typecode, level, version)

takes

1. typecode; a string representing the type of object being queried
2. level; an integer representing an SBML level
3. version; an integer representing an SBML version

returns

1. an SBML structure representing the given typecode, level and version



------------------------------

####identical = areIdentical(SBMLStruct1, SBMLStruct2)

takes

1. SBMLStruct1; any SBML structure
2. SBMLStruct2; any SBML structure

returns

1. identical = 
  - 1 if the structures are identical i.e. contain same fields and the same values
  - 0 otherwise
